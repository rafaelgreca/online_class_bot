We all know that online classes are boring, so let the bot attend them for you!

## Installation

Clone the repository using the following code:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rafaelgreca/online_class_bot.git
```

Install the dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

or

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

## How to use

First of all you need to configure the "classes.csv". You **have to** add classes using the same format and the week day **must be** wrote in English.

After doing that and cloning the repository, you need to create a **.env** file inside the folder and add the following lines:

```bash
EMAIL=YOUR_EMAIL_LOGIN
PASSWORD=YOUR_EMAIL_PASSWORD
BOT_TOKEN=YOUR_DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN
```

All your notifications about attending the classes will be received in the Discord. So you **must have** a text channel called "online-classes" and a bot token to send the messages. (Still improving this part to make it easier to use)

## How it works

The bot will schedule all your classes using the csv file with the information. Then, when the time comes, it will attend to the class. It will leave automatically when the majority of the people leaves and send a notification on your Discord chat.

## Works on

- [x] Google Meet

## How to use

Before running the code you know to confirm that you did the steps above and all configuration was successful. Then you need to fill the classes' table informations like the image bellow.

After doing that, if you didn't install the dependecies please go to the installation section and install before continue. Finally, run the main file using the code bellow:

```python
python3 main.py
```

or if you are using python 2:

```python
python main.py
```

And **you HAVE TO let the programming running** or run it in a server to make sure that the bot will not miss the classes schedule. Check your timezone first and do all the changes for safety, because might have a difference between the timezone used on the code and your country. After a class is finished you will receive a message like this on your discord's channel you made:
